# PET Cup Calculator
A simple and efficient C++ program that estimates the amount of PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) required to manufacture a plastic cup with user-defined dimensions. This project demonstrates practical applications of geometry, volume calculations, and material density conversionâ€”all wrapped in an easy-to-use command-line interface.
